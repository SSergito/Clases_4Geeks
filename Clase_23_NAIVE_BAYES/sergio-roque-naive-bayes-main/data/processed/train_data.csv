keeps crashing it only works well in extreme data savings mode in high data savings mode it keeps crashing and sometimes websites dont loadplease fix this or i am moving to another browser,0
the fail boat has arrived the version is touted as being advanced but in fact it contains a big old disappointment the widget which wasnt even available when google urged us to switch our sms function to hangouts is now no longer available wth fail why do i want to use an sms app or any messaging app which cant even give me a quick review widget on my home screen pffft rolled back to apk and using the standalone google messenger app which offers not one but two excellent widgets one personspecific,0
superfast just as i remember it opera mini was the browser back in the days of symbian glad to see itstill up there superfast smooth minimal data used as opposed to chrome which is starting to stutter lag even on simple pages with a few commercials,1
installed and immediately deleted this crap i have used firefox on my desktop for longer then i can remember and i will continue to only use it on my desktop your only options for a homepage are the crap they want you to see or a blank page with nothing on it and you cant go to a bookmarked website unless you want to go back to their crappy homepage just to see your bookmark list and did i mention its crap,1
totally diferent from the web page do not use this app use the web page instead you will be able to do much more from there it is almost impossible to apply to a job from here,0
very reliable syncing butthe web ui looks like its been designed by a college kid with a laptopno grid viewgb free space in wah photos look ridiculous on list viewthe android app does nothing but getting bigger and bigger with each update without adding up any noticeable featuretoo plain and oversimplified uino download option directly to sd card,0
its great when it works but right now it wont download any mms it just says theyre there and wont download them and then loses the message when i switch to a different app to try to download it instead,1
doesnt let me click into anything always tells me to check my connection while there is literally nothing wrong with my connection i can scroll through my timeline i just cant click into anything since i updated missing my old version smh,0
you dont say what the updates are please take minute and tell us what and why we are updating and not leave the same old message there,0
freaking awesome it has no real story line but it doesnt matterthis was the first video game i ever played so i obviously love itits almost better than super mario brother for crying out loudthe characters are greatthe pigs are cuteand it has my favorite bird in it hall or green birdnot gonna get in to the details of why i love hall but mea also the pigs forts are awesome so thats why i rated angry birds five out of five game of the year,1
neat idea but letdown by no linux support an application like evernote is only as useful as the service behind it and the service behind a concept like evernote is only as useful as the availability of an application or program to connect to said service which is where evernote fails it is not natively available for linuxbased operating systems such as ubuntu sure the android application works well enough but when the only way to access evernote under a linuxbased operating system is via a web browser it quickly looses its appeal,0
not responding occasionally sometimes chrome just wont respond it doesnt seem to be fixated on a certain website or so it happens at random it is far much better than before and yes its not my phones fault as i can just press the home button and operate my phone no problem there,0
best browser but keeps crashing ive no clue but my browser keeps on crashing for unknown reasoneven while browsing on simplest of websitesthis is after the previous update updating again hopefully it goes away,0

bug fixes required this version is much better than the previous one in terms of ui design and data compression this version gives me at least saving the saved pages view is good as well as the tab previews please provide an option to disable vibration for the facebook push notifications and fix the in built wikipedia search engine language every time i search for something through it the page appears in german i have to manually go to the english version of the page and search please fix this,0
great app but one problem ruins it i love the firefox for android its fast and efficient and all the addons are great yet the menu key problem ruins the app firefox will automatically turn on or off the menu key based on if it detects a hardware menu button the only problem is it gets it wrong sometimes and theres no way to force it,1
firefox is getting better slowly it crashes regularly it doesnt play video on youtube otherwise it is a promising fast browser i still miss the gesturesswipes and a well organized homepage with my selected bookmarks see ucbrowser hd,0

no auto upload for photos what worked super on my s does not work on nexus p i have to open the app for photos to back up sad very sad,0

use to be a star app i gave this app star and told them i would give more stars after they fixed a particular problem i was having they fixed that problem so i upped it to stars i would give but im not happy with the changes they made where i now have to use hands to reach for the top of my screen for those functions they use to have on the bottom of the screen this is the only browser i found that does not have to reload every page when hitting the back button definite plus,0
mic on speaker is not working with oneplusx works okay but when put on speaker on one plus x mic stops working it works for skype and normal calls only for hangouts this issue is there,0
back to greatness previously couldnt compose a single message before the app crashed devs fixed issue very quickly well done,1
works fine for the most part not sure why it decides to sometimes notify me and sometimes not i guess it has something to do with inactivity on other logged in devices im usually logged in on computers and a phone,1

fix or i quit dont download this game the new update sucks and is just a money grab for the developers the game wont load half the time and it kicks you off before you can even play not to mention the new rules are made to make you buy gems rather than raid for supplies i have used a lot of money over the years yes years to have you all of a sudden change the rules on farming and game play fix these issues or im done but from what i see in the other comments i dont think the developers even care,0

regular uc better on powerful devices this is very similar to the regular uc browser in function in some ways the layout is cleaner especially in the settings menu the major advantage here is in memory usage typically this will use about mb starting up the regular uc browser uses almost four times the memory however on my samsung galaxy edge the scroll speed is very laggy and stilted i love uc but im sticking with the full version where no such lag occurs its probably not fair to compare them on a high end phone however,1

no respect for privacy linkedin takes advantage of how android manages permissions as well as using an persistent opt out mechanism to aggresively scan your phones contacts in order to constantly nag about inviting them whilst the app harvests your data the practices are unethical and makes one question how the company treats private data linkedin is an important tool to use today but with the way the company behaves it is better to uninstall the app and rely on the web version when its needed,0

widget sabotaged this app functions ok as a notetaker i access it primarily through its widget the old widget was great giving a peek at a few recent notes then that widget was killed off and replaced with a widget that shows only the titles of recent notes with maybe just part of the title of a third note and no content at all it shows poor judgment for a company to downgrade its product for no apparent reason also theres no undo button,1

shite crashes constantly test st does nothing a browser should obviously as all basic function is gone no testing was executed prior to release i do not use youtube or any sites that require more than a browser that loads the page without freezing bonus crashing the operating system,0
i have to call it one of the most addictive games ever but now im dropping my rating because it took all my bonus candy away with the last update fix that guys not ok,0
not what i expected i really thought that the new updates will make the app better but instead it became worst im sorry to say that and i wish if you put this review under consideration and make the newest update better,0

ive used firefox on all my mobile devices and computers for years but since this latest update its become unusable on my galaxy note links either dont work or take you to a different link on the page and the tops bottoms of pages are obscured so only around a third of the page is visible and search boxes cant be accessed i hate the idea of changing to chrome etc but my tablet has been rendered useless for browsing please sort it out mozilla,1
thanks for this app loved this app but my one suggestion,1
nice browser but there is no doubt that firefox is one of the best browsers out there be it pc or mobile great options to customize the browser to suit your needs however this still continues to be my secondary browser as cm browser is still way to fast even when loading heavy websites i hope the speed improves in newer versions and ill add a star rating,1
theres a draught in th supercell needs to fix the draught caused by this update this game is no longer fun theres no loot to upgrade or donate let ths hit lower level bases dead bases are dead were not wiping them just going for collectors this is the only way,0
some time creating problm network problm it seems err more reasons showing,0
gave u too many chances i love desktop firefox this app is brutally annoying an cumbersome ive installed it about times thinkinghoping it would get better there are much better browsers for android than this eg dolphin or maxthon,1
not for me i thought its better than multi language keyboard but its nowhere close to it main problem is that it does not follow the traditional nepali keyboard pattern this may be enough for some to post a short comment but not enough for the ones who likes to write in correct nepali,0
thanks u so much for adding sanshkar fm kalaiya all in one ones app thanks so much dont update its great version,1
uc hello uc browser i start uc browser it s open when i type search bar web address it s loading loading it s not showing any thing but if i use vpn its working well it happen oman lost week so kindly find the solution,1
funny this game is nearly perfect except for ads and then you look at the sequel and think wow rovio messed up our beloved birds used to be such a great franchise,1
excellent app but still needs a bit more work keyboard is fantastic and english to nepali conversion is pretty accurate my only comment on improvement is that you need to improve usability and make it more smooth when typing i want to just use this keyboard even when typing english but unfortunately its not just there yet with samsung or google keyboards also like google keyboard if you add the feature to switch between keyboard by long pressing a button it would be really helpful then itll get stars good stuff nonetheless,1
bugs bugs and more bugs with each update if youre unable to improve something which was already good then dont it upgoogle talk notifications bugs are all over the place edit application must be reloaded ultimately to be able to view messages edit now crashes all day long and requires phone reboot each time,0
