# `001` hello world

In Python, we use `print` to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called "the console".

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows, Linux or macOS arrived).

Today, printing in the console is mostly used as a monitoring and debugging tool, ideal for leaving a trace of the content of variables during the program's execution.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use the `print()` function to print `"Hello World"` on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.

## 📎 Example:

```py
print("How are you?")
```
