# `019` digital clock

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Given the integer `n` - the number of minutes that have passed since midnight, how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock? Write a `digital_clock()` function to calculate it. *The function should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).*

## 📎 Example input:

```py
digital_clock(150)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
(2, 30)
```

For example, if n = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the function should print (2, 30).
